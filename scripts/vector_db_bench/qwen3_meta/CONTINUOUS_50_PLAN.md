# Continuous 50-Round Harness Plan

## Objective
- Run `vector-db-bench` as a **continuous optimization loop**
- Start from the official empty scaffold in round 1
- Start from the **best incumbent so far** in rounds 2 through 50
- Keep the inner agent as close as possible to the official benchmark runtime

## Scope
This is a **separate condition** from the official benchmark baseline.

Official baseline:
- 3 independent attempts
- each starts from blank scaffold
- best of 3 wins

Continuous 50-round loop:
- 50 dependent rounds
- each round starts from the best solution found so far
- outer loop promotes or rejects each round based on measured benchmark results

## Inner Loop
Each round uses the upstream benchmark agent setup:
- scaffold layout from `third_party/vector-db-bench/skeleton/`
- system prompt from `agent/system_prompt.txt`
- opening user message: `Begin. Read the project files and start implementing.`
- tool schema from `agent/src/tools.rs`
- max tool calls: `50`
- same benchmark scoring and recall threshold

The inner loop should remain benchmark-faithful.

## Outer Loop
The outer harness is responsible for:
1. creating a fresh round workspace
2. seeding it from the incumbent
3. running the upstream agent
4. parsing the round result
5. promoting or rejecting the result
6. appending a ledger row to `results.tsv`
7. writing compact round summaries only as needed
7. repeating for 50 rounds

## Initialization Policy

### Round 1
- seed from official empty scaffold

### Rounds 2-50
- seed from the current incumbent snapshot

The incumbent snapshot must be a full buildable candidate, not just partial source files.

## Incumbent Snapshot
Canonical incumbent directory should include:
- `src/`
- `Cargo.toml`
- `Cargo.lock`

Recommended path:
- `data/vector_db_bench/qwen3_meta/continuous_50/incumbent/`

This should be treated as the primary compressed memory of the search, mirroring
autoresearch's use of the current branch state as the kept best code.

## Keep / Reject Rule
Version 1 should promote based on an **independent final evaluation of the
round's final workspace**, not the agent's internal `best_benchmark` snapshot.

Reason:
- the upstream agent only backs up `src/` to `src_best_qps/`
- it does not snapshot `Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock`
- the internal "best" result may come from an intermediate benchmark run rather
  than the final buildable workspace we want to carry forward

Promote the round result if:
- the round's **independent final strict-valid QPS** is greater than incumbent QPS
- recall remains valid
- anti-cheat remains valid

Otherwise:
- reject the round
- keep the previous incumbent unchanged

This is strict hill-climbing on measured benchmark performance.

## Round Outputs
Each round directory should contain:
- seeded workspace
- `agent_log.jsonl`
- `eval_log.json`
- benchmark outputs
- profiling outputs
- promoted candidate snapshot if applicable
- optional round summary

Recommended layout:

```text
data/vector_db_bench/qwen3_meta/continuous_50/
  incumbent/
  results.tsv
  summary.json
  round_001/
  round_002/
  ...
  round_050/
```

## Round Summary Fields
Per round, record:
- `round`
- `seed_source`
- `best_qps`
- `final_qps`
- `recall`
- `recall_passed`
- `tool_calls_used`
- `elapsed_secs`
- `promoted`
- `promotion_reason`
- `notes`

## Autoresearch-Style Memory Model
The memory model should follow Karpathy's autoresearch pattern closely.

### Primary memory: incumbent state
- current incumbent code is the main memory
- successful changes become the new seed for future rounds
- rejected changes are discarded and do not persist

### Secondary memory: `results.tsv`
- one row per round
- durable record of:
  - round
  - score
  - status
  - short description of the idea
- this is the main structured experiment history the outer loop can inspect

Suggested columns:

```text
round	best_qps	final_qps	recall	status	description
```

where:
- `status` is one of `keep`, `discard`, or `crash`

### Tertiary memory: latest round logs
- `agent_log.jsonl`
- `eval_log.json`
- benchmark outputs
- profiling outputs

These provide detailed debugging context for the most recent round when needed.

### Optional memory: `memory.md`
Do **not** carry full transcripts between rounds.

If needed, add a small handoff memo only after the basic loop works:
- current incumbent QPS / recall
- recent successful ideas
- recent failed ideas
- repeated compile/runtime failures
- next likely moves

Recommended optional path:
- `data/vector_db_bench/qwen3_meta/continuous_50/memory.md`

Version 1 should work even without this file.

## Prompt Policy
First version should minimize prompt drift:
- keep the same upstream system prompt
- keep the same upstream opening user message for round 1
- for rounds 2+, inject one additional short user message via preseeded
  `session_context.json`:
  - current incumbent QPS / recall
  - the fact that the workspace is already seeded from the incumbent
  - the objective to beat the incumbent while keeping recall >= 0.95

Optional future extension:
- prepend a short research memo as an additional user message

But that should come after the seeded-incumbent loop works correctly.
The first implementation should rely mainly on:
- incumbent code
- `results.tsv`
- latest logs

## Benchmark Repo Choice
Use the **clean benchmark clone** on the Linux host, not the dirty submodule checkout.

Recommended host path:
- `/home/jonx/code/vector-db-bench-official-baseline`

Reason:
- the dirty checkout already contains scaffold modifications and is not baseline-safe

## Profiling Requirement
The inner loop uses `run_profiling`, so profiling must work.

Current status:
- fixed user-locally on the Linux host
- `perf`, `stackcollapse-perf.pl`, and `flamegraph.pl` are available
- FlameGraph Perl dependency was also fixed in user space

## Runtime Expectations
Observed from the first exact-format baseline run:
- approximately `26.6 minutes` for one full 50-call round

Estimated 50-round wall-clock cost if fully serial:
- roughly `22 hours`

This is long but feasible as a day-long experiment.

## Minimal Implementation Plan

### Step 1
Implement `run_continuous_loop.py`

Responsibilities:
- create round workspaces
- seed from incumbent
- invoke the upstream agent runtime
- parse `eval_log.json`
- compare against incumbent
- promote or reject
- append to `results.tsv`
- preserve latest logs per round

### Step 2
Run a 3-round pilot

Success criteria:
- incumbent promotion works
- rejected rounds do not corrupt incumbent
- logs and artifacts are stored correctly

### Step 3
Scale to 50 rounds

## Non-Goals For V1
- no Codex outer-agent edits yet
- no tool-schema changes yet
- no custom prompt rewriting yet
- no benchmark rule changes

Version 1 should isolate the effect of:
- incumbent seeding
- outer keep/reject logic

## Future Extensions
After the seeded 50-round loop is stable:
- add Codex as an outer optimizer
- allow prompt adapter evolution
- allow tool-wrapper evolution
- add compact round-memory injection

## Immediate Next Step
Implement:
- `scripts/vector_db_bench/qwen3_meta/run_continuous_loop.py`

and validate it on:
- 3 continuous rounds
